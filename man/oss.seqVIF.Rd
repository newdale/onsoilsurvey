\title{Perform Sequential Variable Inflation Factor Analysis}
\usage{
oss.seqVIF(cov_df, thresh, trace = FALSE, show.R2.vals = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{cov_df}{data.frame* object where each column represent covariate values.}

\item{thresh}{numeric* object Perform sequential VIF until all covariates have VIF scores lower than this value}

\item{trace}{Boolean* object (default = FALSE). Should the results of each VIF be shown in the console?}

\item{show.R2.vals}{Boolean* object (default = FALSE) Should the VIF score be also described as an R squared value? (VIF = 1/1-R2)}
}
\value{
Returns a list of 4 objects: 1. Covariates_retained: First object is the column names of the covariates that are kept (i.e. have VIF scores lower than threshold).
2. Covariates_removed: Second object is the column names of the covariates were removed (i.e., have VIF scores higher than threshold).
3. VIF_removed: Third object is a summary of the VIF scores of each covariate that was removed. NA indicates scores fell below threshold and removal was not performed.
4. VIF_all: Forth object is a complete report of each VIF score for each covariate for each time VIF was run.
