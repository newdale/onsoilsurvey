Description: This package is a collection of functions used for digital soil mapping in Ontario. 
 It includes functions for creating spatial covariates, for generating fit statistics for trained models, 
 for generating  additional fit statistics (concordance, bias) directly from caret model outputs, 
 for running a sequential variance inflation factor analysis for covaraite reduction, for assigning 
 soil texture classes based on particle size data, and for computing divergence metrics to assist in sample design.
